A Library bundled for the ITDevCon 2014 presentation "Immersive Audio Programming", which contains the necessary code to build a platform independent audio environment with Delphi.

The library is written in pure Object Pascal and thus might not be the fastest code. However, this has the advantage of platform independence. The code should run on all platforms, except for the PortAudio interface, which is limited to the major Desktop platforms (Windows, OSX and Linux). Since the library uses generics and other rather modern language features it only runs in XE and above.
